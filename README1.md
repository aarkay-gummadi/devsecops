----------------------

* Letâ€™s break down the process of deploying your application using Kubernetes (K8s), Jenkins, Docker, and other tools:

### Write Deployment Code:
* Developers write the application code and create deployment manifests (K8s YAML files) that define how the application should be deployed.

### Version Control with GitHub:
* Push the deployment code to a GitHub repository for version control and collaboration.

### Build and Package:
* Set up a `Jenkins pipeline` that listens for changes in the GitHub repository.
* When changes are detected, Jenkins triggers a build process.
* The build process compiles the code, packages it into a Docker image, and tags the image.

### Security Scanning with Trivy:
* Integrate `Trivy`, a vulnerability scanner for containers, into the Jenkins pipeline.
* Trivy scans the Docker image for known vulnerabilities and reports any findings.

### Push to DockerHub:
* If the security scan passes, Jenkins pushes the Docker image to DockerHub or another container registry.

### Create EKS Cluster with Terraform:
* Use Terraform to define and provision an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster.
* Terraform applies the configuration, creating the necessary resources on AWS.

### Deploy Using K8s Manifests:
* Apply the K8s deployment manifests to the EKS cluster.
* These manifests define the desired state of your application, including pods, services, and ingress.

### Ingress Controller:
* Set up an Ingress controller (e.g., Nginx Ingress) to route external traffic to the appropriate services within the cluster.

### Scale and Manage:
* Use K8s features to scale your application horizontally (e.g., replicas, autoscaling).
* Perform rolling updates when deploying new versions.

### Scan Deployment with Kubescape:
* Integrate Kubescape, a tool for assessing K8s security posture, into your pipeline.
* Kubescape scans the deployed resources for security risks and misconfigurations.
